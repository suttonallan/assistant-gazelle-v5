Subject: Event created with isTuning:true but not appearing in piano service history

Hello Gazelle Support Team,

We are experiencing an issue with the GraphQL API where events created with 
isTuning:true are not appearing in the piano's service history, even though 
they are correctly associated with the piano.

WHAT WORKS:
✅ We can create an event using createEvent mutation with:
   - type: APPOINTMENT
   - pianos: [{"pianoId": "ins_xxx", "isTuning": true}]
✅ The event is successfully created and associated with the piano
✅ The "This is a tuning for this piano" checkbox is correctly checked in the UI
✅ We can complete the event using completeEvent with resultType: COMPLETE
✅ The event status becomes COMPLETE
✅ The isTuning flag remains true throughout the process

WHAT DOESN'T WORK:
❌ The completed event does NOT appear in the piano's service history
❌ Even though the event is:
   - Type: APPOINTMENT
   - Status: COMPLETE
   - Associated with the piano (piano checkbox checked)
   - Marked as tuning (isTuning: true checkbox checked)

WHAT WE'VE TRIED:
1. createEvent with pianos and isTuning: true
2. updateEvent to ensure isTuning is set
3. completeEvent with resultType: COMPLETE
4. Various combinations of the above

QUESTIONS:
1. Is there a specific mutation or field required to make a COMPLETE APPOINTMENT 
   event with isTuning:true appear in the piano's service history?
2. Are there additional requirements beyond isTuning:true and status: COMPLETE?
3. Is there a different mutation (like addServiceHistory) that should be used 
   instead of createEvent for service history entries?
4. Does the event need to be in a specific date range or have other specific 
   properties to appear in service history?

Example event ID for reference: evt_VA1oI96XldqVmipZ
Piano ID: ins_1HdzW806WqxPo2Gh

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards
